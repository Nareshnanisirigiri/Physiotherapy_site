Our stroke rehabilitation protocol is grounded in the latest evidence-based practices, designed to help survivors relearn skills that were lost when part of the brain was damaged. We believe that early and intensive intervention is key to maximizing recovery potential and preventing long-term disability.

Our approach integrates constraint-induced movement therapy (CIMT) and repetitive task practice to encourage the use of affected limbs. We also focus heavily on core stability and strength training to improve overall mobility. Whether it is regaining the ability to speak, swallow, or walk, our dedicated therapists provide the expert guidance and physical support needed to navigate these challenges.

We also recognize the emotional toll of a stroke on both the patient and their family. Our program includes education and counseling to help families understand the recovery process and how best to support their loved ones at home. By fostering a collaborative care environment, we aim to restore not just function, but also confidence and quality of life.`,

The therapy involves specific head and eye movement exercises, as well as balance challenges on varied surfaces. For BPPV, we perform precise canalith repositioning maneuvers (like the Epley maneuver) to dislodge crystals in the inner ear. These treatments often provide immediate relief from acute vertigo symptoms.

Long-term management involves fall prevention strategies and habituation exercises to reduce sensitivity to motion. We work on building your confidence in moving around freely without the fear of falling. By improving your stability and gaze focus, we help you get back to driving, working, and enjoying life without the constant sensation of spinning.`,

We also focus heavily on range of motion, ensuring that you regain full flexibility in the affected area.

The final phase of rehab is functional restoration, where we simulate activities specific to your lifestyle or sport.

Our COMA Care program focuses on sensory stimulation and physical maintenance to encourage arousal and prevent the severe complications of immobility. We use a multisensory stimulation kit involving sound, touch, smell, and vision to try and reach the patient.

Physical management includes a rigorous schedule of positioning and passive movements to prevent bedsores and contractures (permanent tightening of muscles/joints). Chest physiotherapy is performed regularly to keep the lungs clear and prevent infections like pneumonia. We also train family members on how to interact with and care for the patient, empowering them to be partners in care.

While recovery patterns can be unpredictable, maintaining the body's physical integrity is crucial for any potential future rehabilitation. Our dedicated team provides dignified and attentive care, ensuring that every opportunity for improvement is maximized while maintaining the highest quality of life possible for the patient.`,

Our Pain Management program moves beyond just treating the symptoms to addressing the root causes and the central sensitization of the nervous system. We use a multidisciplinary approach that combines physical therapies with pain neuroscience education.

We use modalities like trigger point therapy and electrotherapy to provide short-term relief, creating a window of opportunity for movement. The core of the program, however, is graded exposure—gradually introducing movements that were previously painful or feared. This helps to desensitize the nervous system and retrain the brain's pain pathways.

Relaxation techniques and mindfulness are also key components, helping to break the pain-tension-pain cycle. We work with you to identify triggers and develop coping strategies. Our goal is to shift the focus from "pain elimination" to "function restoration," allowing you to live a rich and meaningful life despite the presence of pain.`,

For existing wounds, we provide specialized wound care support to promote healing. We also focus on improving circulation through gentle mobility exercises and massage of surrounding tissues. Nutrition and hydration advice is provided, as these are critical factors in skin integrity and healing capability.

Caregiver education is the most sustainable part of this program. We train family members and carers on how to inspect the skin, how to turn and position the patient safely, and how to use mobility aids. By creating a proactive care environment, we aim to heal existing sores and prevent new ones from forming, significantly improving the patient's comfort.`,
